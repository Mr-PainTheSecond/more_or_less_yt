YouTube More Or Less
Made by Santiago Sanhueza
Inspired by More Or Less https://moreorless.io/

How To Use:
You are expected to have Python and Pip Installations.

You will also need an API key for the YouTube Data API. Instructions on how
to get one may be found here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started.
The API key and all requests used are free, it only limits your daily usage. 

Once you have the API key, download the root folder, and create a .env file following
the same format as the .env.example file. To start the game, go to the more_or_less_yt
folder and click on the more_or_less_yt.exe file. All C dependencies are included in this
folder, and all Python dependencies will be autoinstalled if they are not included in your
Python configuration
